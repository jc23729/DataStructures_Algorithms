// Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

// function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not.


function areAnagram(str1, str2) {
    // Get the length of both the strings.
    let len1 = str1.length,
    let n2 = str2.length;
}
